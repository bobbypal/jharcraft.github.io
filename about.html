                <h5 class="card-title">About Us</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Jharkhand Silk Textile and Handicraft Development Corporation Ltd., also known as
                    JHARCRAFT, is a government of Jharkhand undertaking. Jharcraft was formed to create sustainable
                    livelihood opportunities in the rural areas, based on Sericulture, Handloom, Handicraft and other
                    allied activities.

                    In the year 2006, Jharcraft was started as an organisation to create new opportunities in rural
                    areas with an objective to change lives throughout the state. In the first year, the organisation
                    was engaged in organizing production units of various categories. Today, it provides both, forward
                    and backward linkage to the Handloom and Handicrafts sectors for a sustainable source of livelihood.
                    It was formed to provide aggressive marketing to the merchandise made by the rural artists.

                    Jharcraft supports the whole value chain of production and marketing including, providing raw
                    materials, training, designs and marketing. The poor artisans of Jharkhand who have recognised silk
                    production as a source of income have enhanced their skills in quality and varieties of products
                    like: organic fabrics, silk sarees, Designer garments, Home Furnishing etc.

                    The appreciation and purchase of these wonderful natural fabric will breathe new life into the lives
                    of the artisans and help enrich their brilliant culture..</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">OUR VISION</h5>
                <p class="card-text">With the mission of "Creating Opportunities and Changing Lives", Jharcraft is
                    viewed as the supporting unit to the state, contributing maximum to its social, economical, and
                    cultural uplift, rise and growth.

                    Our vision associated to the organisation focuses on the following :</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Women have the power to give life and Jharcraft believes that she is naturally
                    empowered to change lives as well. Playing important roles in a family she forms a better half of
                    the society.

                    The golden history of the nation points to the fact that the future of the nation can not be
                    directed towards 'Glory' without women participation.

                    The women employment is matter of major concern of the organisation so as to make them self
                    dependent. Through Jharcraft each woman earns around Rs. 4000/- to Rs. 5000/- per month which
                    enables them to look well after their family, educate their children, and contribute to the
                    betterment of the family and society.</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">EMPLOYMENT GENERATION</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our vision expands towards fulfilling cumulative dreams through creation of
                    sustainable livelihood models based on sericulture, handloom and handicrafts.

                    Through maximum utilisation of natural resources and labour power available in the rural areas of
                    the state, Jharcraft aims to provide each hand its value and add to employment and income
                    generation.

                    The cottage and household industries have potential to become the backbone to the state economy and
                    can generate maximum employment with minimum cost ensuring a bright future.

                    Jharcraft provides support to promote handicrafts, handloom & tasar silk production. Woodcrafts,
                    Bamboo-works, Dhokra-art, Terracotta products, Lac bangles, Cotton handloom, Applique work, Zardozi
                    work, Tasar products, and various other forms of human art, have gained new horizons through
                    Jharcraft.</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">FINANCIAL REVOLUTION</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Jharcraft is a step towards creation of an era of financial revolution throughout
                    the state. The potentials of the state have been explored by Jharcraft, the goals have been set and
                    the path has been built to reach to development. Also, the journey to financial revolution has
                    begun. Jharcraft focuses mainly on the upliftment of the rural areas, self help groups, and cottage
                    and household industries to bring about a noticeable change in the financial status of the rural
                    sector of the state contributing to whole of the economy of the state.

                    Each woman associated to the organisation, earning Rs. 4000-5000/- per month, surely proves the
                    changes being brought about in these remote areas. Also the rate of migration of people to other
                    states going down ensures that the revolution would soon be very prominent and success rate would be
                    quiet high.</p>
